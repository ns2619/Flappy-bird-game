## Getting Started
## Folder Structure
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).


Creating a weather website or app for a specific location involves several steps, ranging from choosing the right technology to designing the user interface and sourcing weather data. Here's a breakdown of the process, focusing on both web and app development:
 **I. Planning & Design:** 
 1. **Define Scope and Features:** * **Location Specificity:** 
 Will it only cover one location, or allow users to select different locations? * 
 **Data Points:** What information will you display? (Temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction, precipitation, UV index, sunrise/sunset times, air quality, etc.) * **Timeframes:** Will you show current conditions, hourly forecasts, daily forecasts, or longer-term predictions? * **Visualizations:** How will you present the data? (Charts, graphs, icons, maps) * **User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX):** Sketch out the layout and user flow. Consider responsiveness for different screen sizes (desktop, mobile, tablet). * **Monetization (Optional):** Will you display ads, offer premium features, or charge subscriptions? 
 
 2. **Choose a Technology Stack:** 
   
   **A. Website:** *
   
   **Frontend (what the user sees):** HTML, CSS, JavaScript are essential. Consider using a framework like React, Vue, or Angular for larger projects to manage complexity. * 
   
   **Backend (data handling and logic):** You'll need a server-side language (Python, Node.js, PHP, Ruby on Rails, etc.) and a database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) to store data (though you likely won't store *all* weather data; see data sources below). A framework like Flask (Python), Express.js (Node.js), or similar can simplify development. * 
   
   **API (Application Programming Interface):** This is how your website will communicate with the weather data source. 
   
   **B. App (Android/iOS):** * 
   
   **Native Development:** Requires separate development for Android (Java/Kotlin) and iOS (Swift/Objective-C). This provides the best performance and access to device features. * 
   
   **Cross-Platform Development:** Frameworks like React Native, Flutter, or Xamarin allow you to build for both platforms with a single codebase. This is generally faster but might have some performance limitations. * 
   
   **API:** Same as for websites. 
 
 **II. Data Acquisition:** 

 1. **Choose a Weather API:** Many APIs provide weather data. Popular options include: 
  * **OpenWeatherMap:** A widely used and relatively inexpensive option. 
  * **WeatherAPI:** Offers a variety of data and plans. 
  * **AccuWeather:** A well-known provider, but may be more expensive. 
  * **Dark Sky (now owned by Apple):** High-quality data, but access is restricted. Consider alternatives. 
  
 2. **API Key:** You'll need an API key from your chosen provider to access their data. Many offer free tiers with usage limits. 
 
 3. **Data Handling:** Your backend will fetch data from the API, potentially store some (like recent forecasts) in a database for faster access, and process it into a format suitable for display on your website or app. 
 
 **III. Development:** 
 1. **Frontend Development:** Build the UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or your chosen framework). Use the API data to populate the website/app with weather information. 
 2. **Backend Development (if applicable):** Create the server-side logic to fetch data from the API, handle user requests, and interact with the database (if used). 
 3. **API Integration:** Implement the code to communicate with the weather API and handle responses. 
 4. **Testing:** Thoroughly test your website/app on different devices and browsers to ensure it works correctly. 
 
 **IV. Deployment:** 
 1. **Website:** Host your website on a web hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud). 
 2. **App:** For native apps, you'll need to publish them to the Google Play Store (Android) and Apple App Store (iOS). For cross-platform apps, the deployment process depends on the framework used.
 
 **V. Iteration and Maintenance:** 
 1. **User Feedback:** Collect feedback from users to improve your website/app. 
 2. **Updates:** Regularly update your website/app to fix bugs, add features, and improve performance. 
 3. **API Changes:** Keep an eye on changes to the weather API you're using, as updates might require code adjustments. 
 
 **Example (Conceptual Python/Flask Backend with OpenWeatherMap):** 
 ```python from flask import Flask, jsonify import requests app = Flask(__name__) # Replace with your OpenWeatherMap API key OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY" @app.route('/weather/') def get_weather(city): url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={OPENWEATHER_API_KEY}&units=metric" response = requests.get(url) data = response.json() return jsonify(data) if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug=True) ``` 
 
 This is a simplified example. A real-world application would involve more sophisticated error handling, data processing, and security measures. Remember to consult the API documentation for your chosen provider. This outline should give you a solid starting point for your weather website or app project. Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
